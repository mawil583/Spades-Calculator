Flow:

when game starts, current round is initialized
each time player selects bid, an event handler is fired which checks whether the current round is finished (allBidsAndActualsAreEntered)
if current round is finished, then inputs are added to roundHistory, currentRound values are reset, and round number is incremented
when roundHistory is > 0, then we render a PastRounds.reverse()

TODO:
break out components into smaller components
write tests for when we go over bags (-100 penalty)
test whether a change to localStorage variable name will cause app crash for someone who already has deprecated variable name stored on their localStorage
