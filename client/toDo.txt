--High Priority--
improve separation of concerns for CurrentRound vs SpadesRound
implement editable past rounds

--Backlog--
break out components into smaller components on Names page
rename Names.js to something more like LandingPage or HomePage
test whether a change to localStorage variable name will cause app crash for someone who already has deprecated variable name stored on their localStorage
instead of storing a bunch of pieces of state, declare large state object array using useReducer
warning modal when user clicks 'new game'. The modal should prompt the user with question (New game with same teams?)
validation for total Actuals being more than 13
add color theme to more clearly delineate teams (so that users don't accidentally enter data for the wrong team)
add dynamic dealer tag
improve layout
implement accordions for past rounds, except for the most recent past round. That one should always be open because it's the most common past round to inquire about
consider adding more info to RoundSummary: [game score at start of round (but find a way to make it shorter), game score at end of round, bags taken, total bags at current round]. If I implement a lot of this, then make another mini accordion that sits within RoundSummary
make sure that the RoundSummary for the most recent past round is fully within view on all mobile devices
add animation for when last bidsAndActuals is entered. Would be nice if a finished round would slide downward as the next CurrentRound is initialized
make layout responsive for tablet/desktop usage
implement validation for name length and team length such that it won't create layout issues on small mobile devices. consider also adding CSS that makes longer names possible without messing up the layout
BUG: when i clear localStorage, and then go back to homepage (names.js), and then I go back to /spades-calculator, I get error 'Cannot read properties of null (reading 'team1Name')'
