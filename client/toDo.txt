--High Priority--
Add ScoreSettings component to LandingPage with ChakraUI radio component. Also add an 'info' popup explaining the differences. Make sure this setting is stored in localStorage
add settings for each way of scoring nil. does a nil player receive a bag for each trick won? yes! Also, tricks taken by nil bidder to not count towards team's overall score. i.e. if p1 bids nil and p2 bids 1, but p1 takes 1 and p2 takes 0, the team score should be (-100 + 1) + (-10) = -109 with 1 bag. Change spadesMath.js! Also edit test file accordingly
warning modal when user clicks 'new game'. The modal should prompt the user with question (New game with same teams?)
add dynamic dealer tag
fix bug where if a CurrentRound is partially complete, and user clicks 'New Game', it does not clear the roundState. it only clears roundHistory. The button state does not get cleared. The fix: resetRoundValues state needs to be lifted up so that we can reset CurrentRoundState when user clicks 'New Game'
validation for total Actuals being more than 13
implement validation for name length and team length such that it won't create layout issues on small mobile devices. consider also adding CSS that makes longer names possible without messing up the layout

--Backlog--
make it more obvious that team names are editable and that past rounds are editable
change text for past rounds. Instead of saying 'someone's getting set', say 'someone got set'. Or even, 'Team 1 got set'
add text to PastRound Actuals. if someone went over 10 bags, or got set, or failed nil, let user know
break out components into smaller components on Names page
improve separation of concerns for CurrentRound vs PastRound
names was already set in Names.js. Consider making global state that I can grab from for cleaner solution than reaching for localStorage names in SpadesCalculator
test whether a change to localStorage variable name will cause app crash for someone who already has deprecated variable name stored on their localStorage
instead of storing a bunch of pieces of state, declare large state object array using useReducer
add color theme to more clearly delineate teams (so that users don't accidentally enter data for the wrong team)
improve layout
implement accordions for past rounds, except for the most recent past round. That one should always be open because it's the most common past round to inquire about
consider adding more info to RoundSummary: [game score at start of round (but find a way to make it shorter), game score at end of round, bags taken, total bags at current round]. If I implement a lot of this, then make a drawer component that sits within RoundSummary
make sure that the RoundSummary for the most recent past round is fully within view on all mobile devices
add animation for when last bidsAndActuals is entered. Would be nice if a finished round would slide downward as the next CurrentRound is initialized
make layout responsive for tablet/desktop usage
figure out UX when user selects New Game button (do they get prompted with 'same players'? or 'are you sure? your data will be deleted') or if I should create different buttons for each action.
figure out what to do with functions that require a lot of parameters
implement typescript
simplify spadesMath - make sure calculateScoreFromRoundHistory doesn't require both teams. It should just be calculateTeamScoreFromRoundHistory
make ActualsSection conditional. It should only show when all bids are entered. It should also animate downwards.
make team names editable on SpadesCalculator page
when someone bids, the button turns into text of what they bid. Keep it as a button so that users understand that it's editable
optimize app - make sure there are no unnecessary re-renders
add info page where I describe the rules that I have implemented (currently it's "helps team out"), and provide source on failed nil (https://www.trickstercards.com/home/help/HowToPlay.aspx?game=spades)
add class for spadesMath, and extend that class to add other settings for how game is scored
implement ability for user to select which scoring rules they want to follow
remove unused calculateScoreFromRoundHistory and corresponding dependencies
add more tests for calculateTeamRoundScoresFromTeamHistory and calculateTeamScoreFromRoundHistory
clean up BidSection Heading. Maybe split it into more components
Address comments on whoWentNil function


Matt's suggestions:
make sure that PastRound and CurrentRound don't know or set gameScore
BidsAndActuals should only be inside of currentRound or PastRound
