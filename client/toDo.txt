--High Priority--
add dynamic dealer tag
warning modal when user clicks 'new game'. The modal should prompt the user with question (New game with same teams?)
fix bug where gameScoreAtEndOfRound is always lagging behind, even with refresh
improve separation of concerns for CurrentRound vs PastRound
refine editable past rounds

--Backlog--
break out components into smaller components on Names page
rename Names.js to something more like LandingPage or HomePage
test whether a change to localStorage variable name will cause app crash for someone who already has deprecated variable name stored on their localStorage
instead of storing a bunch of pieces of state, declare large state object array using useReducer
validation for total Actuals being more than 13
add color theme to more clearly delineate teams (so that users don't accidentally enter data for the wrong team)
improve layout
implement accordions for past rounds, except for the most recent past round. That one should always be open because it's the most common past round to inquire about
consider adding more info to RoundSummary: [game score at start of round (but find a way to make it shorter), game score at end of round, bags taken, total bags at current round]. If I implement a lot of this, then make a drawer component that sits within RoundSummary
make sure that the RoundSummary for the most recent past round is fully within view on all mobile devices
add animation for when last bidsAndActuals is entered. Would be nice if a finished round would slide downward as the next CurrentRound is initialized
make layout responsive for tablet/desktop usage
implement validation for name length and team length such that it won't create layout issues on small mobile devices. consider also adding CSS that makes longer names possible without messing up the layout
BUG: when i clear localStorage, and then go back to homepage (names.js), and then I manually type in the URL /spades-calculator, I get error 'Cannot read properties of null (reading 'team1Name')'
figure out UX when user selects New Game button (do they get prompted with 'same players'? or 'are you sure? your data will be deleted') or if I should create different buttons for each action.
figure out what to do with functions that require a lot of parameters
implement typescript
simplify spadesMath - make sure calculateScoreFromRoundHistory doesn't require both teams. It should just be calculateTeamScoreFromRoundHistory
make ActualsSection conditional. It should only show when all bids are entered. It should also animate downwards.
make team names editable on SpadesCalculator page
when someone bids, the button turns into text of what they bid. Keep it as a button so that users understand that it's editable
optimize app - make sure there are no unnecessary re-renders

Matt's suggestions:
make sure that PastRound and CurrentRound don't know or set gameScore
BidsAndActuals should only be inside of currentRound or PastRound
